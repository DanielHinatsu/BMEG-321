# BMEG-321
Compilation of Matlab signal processing code from BMEG 321

THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVE GITHUB, rather an archive of the various lab assignments aimed at processing and simulating biological signals.  Each file corresponds to the appendix code from a lab assignment. 

This repository represents the combined work of Daniel Hinatsu, Ellie McGregor and Joyce Xi. The code is created and adapted for use in UBC's BMEG 321 signal processing course
